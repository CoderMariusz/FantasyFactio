key_decisions:

    rationale: "8-week timeline, 170 SP, core features only, iterative releases"
    date: "2025-11-17"

  - decision: "Solo Developer Velocity: 25 SP/week (realistic)"
    rationale: "Adjusted from 35-40 SP/week based on Flame learning curve"
    date: "2025-11-17"

  - decision: "Deferred to Post-MVP: Progression, Tutorial, Monetization (119 SP)"
