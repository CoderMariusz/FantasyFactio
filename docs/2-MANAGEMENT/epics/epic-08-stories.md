## STORY-08.1: IAP Product Catalog & Domain (2 SP)

### Objective
Define all 5 IAP products with properties, purchase state model, and domain entities.

### User Story
As a developer, I need clearly defined IAP products and purchase state model so the monetization system has a solid foundation.

### Description
This story creates the domain layer for monetization: product definitions, purchase state tracking, and result types. All prices, gold amounts, and rules are defined here.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: IAPProduct Enum
```dart
✅ 5 products defined:
   - Starter Pack: $1.99, 1000 gold
   - Builder Pack: $2.99, 1750 gold
   - Factory Pack: $4.99, 3500 gold, isBestValue: true
   - Master Pack: $9.99, 8000 gold
   - Remove Ads: $0.99, 0 gold, isPermanent: true

✅ Each product has:
   - id: String (platform ID)
   - displayName: String
   - price: double
   - goldAmount: int
   - description: String
```

#### AC2: PurchaseState Model
```dart
✅ PurchaseState class:
   - totalSpent: double (lifetime, e.g., 6.50)
   - purchasedProducts: List<String> (product IDs)
   - adsRemoved: bool

✅ Methods:
   - canPurchase(product): bool
   - remainingBudget: double (10.0 - totalSpent)
   - capReached: bool
   - recordPurchase(product): PurchaseState
```

#### AC3: $10 Lifetime Cap Constant
```
✅ Static constant:
   static const double lifetimeCap = 10.0;

✅ Cap logic:
   - canPurchase returns false if (totalSpent + price) > 10.0
   - Cap applies to ALL products including Remove Ads
```

#### AC4: PurchaseResult Types
```dart
✅ Sealed class hierarchy:
   - PurchaseSuccess (product, transactionId, date)
   - PurchaseFailure (error, message)

✅ PurchaseError enum:
   - capReached
   - userCancelled
   - networkError
   - invalidReceipt
   - alreadyPurchased
   - platformError
```

#### AC5: Unit Tests Pass
```
✅ Test: All 5 products defined correctly
✅ Test: canPurchase true when under cap
✅ Test: canPurchase false when would exceed cap
✅ Test: recordPurchase updates totalSpent
✅ Test: remainingBudget calculates correctly
✅ Test: capReached true at $10.00
```

### Implementation Notes

**Files to Create:**
- `lib/domain/entities/iap_product.dart` - Product enum
- `lib/domain/entities/purchase_state.dart` - State model
- `lib/domain/entities/purchase_result.dart` - Result types
- `test/domain/entities/iap_product_test.dart` - Tests

**Gold per Dollar Calculation:**
```
Starter: 1000g / $1.99 = 502g/$
Builder: 1750g / $2.99 = 585g/$
Factory: 3500g / $4.99 = 701g/$ ← Best Value
Master:  8000g / $9.99 = 801g/$ ← Best overall
```

**Dependencies:**
- None (pure domain layer)

**Blocks:**
- STORY-08.2 (PurchaseManager uses these)

## STORY-08.2: Purchase Manager & Cap Enforcement (4 SP)

### Objective
Implement PurchaseManager that enforces $10 lifetime cap and orchestrates purchase flow.

### User Story
As a player, I want the game to prevent me from spending more than $10 so I'm protected from overspending.

### Description
PurchaseManager is the central orchestrator. It checks the cap, initiates platform purchases, validates receipts, grants rewards, and updates state.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Cap Enforcement
```dart
✅ Before any purchase:
   - Check if (totalSpent + product.price) <= 10.0
   - If false: Return PurchaseFailure(capReached)
   - Log analytics: iap_purchase_blocked

✅ Edge cases:
   - Exactly $10.00 total: Allow last purchase
   - $9.99 + $0.02: Block (would be $10.01)
```

#### AC2: Purchase Flow Orchestration
```
✅ purchaseProduct() flow:
   1. Check lifetime cap
   2. Log iap_purchase_initiated
   3. Call platform IAP (Google/Apple)
   4. Validate receipt server-side
   5. Grant gold to player
   6. Update purchase state (Firestore)
   7. Log iap_purchase_completed
   8. Return PurchaseSuccess
```

#### AC3: Error Handling
```
✅ Handle all error cases:
   - Cap exceeded: Show cap message
   - User cancelled: Silent (expected)
   - Network error: Retry option
   - Invalid receipt: Fraud alert, no gold
   - Already purchased: Show message

✅ Graceful degradation:
   - Network issues: Retry with backoff
   - Platform errors: Clear error message
```

#### AC4: State Persistence
```
✅ Firestore integration:
   - Save to /users/{uid}/purchases
   - Fields: totalSpent, purchasedProducts, adsRemoved
   - Sync across devices

✅ Optimistic updates:
   - UI updates immediately
   - Background sync to Firestore
```

#### AC5: Unit Tests Pass
```
✅ Test: Cap blocks purchase correctly
✅ Test: Successful purchase updates state
✅ Test: Failed receipt validation returns error
✅ Test: State persists to Firestore
✅ Test: Analytics events logged
```

```

**Dependencies:**
- STORY-08.1 (Domain entities)
- STORY-08.3 (Platform IAP)

## STORY-08.3: Platform IAP Integration (5 SP)

### Objective
Integrate Google Play Billing (Android) and Apple StoreKit (iOS) for real purchases.

### User Story
As a player, I want to make purchases through my device's app store so my payment is secure and familiar.

     in_app_purchase: ^3.1.11

✅ Platform configuration:

✅ IAPManager.getAvailableProducts():
   - Fetch from platform store
   - Return real prices (localized)
   - Handle unavailable products

✅ Product availability:
   - Check connection status
   - Handle store not available
```

#### AC3: Purchase Flow - Android
```
✅ Google Play Billing:
   - Dialog appears with product details
   - Payment method selection
   - Fingerprint/Face authentication
   - Transaction ID returned

✅ Error handling:
   - User cancelled: Normal flow
   - Payment failed: Show message
   - Pending: Handle on next launch
```

#### AC4: Purchase Flow - iOS
```
✅ Apple StoreKit:
   - Payment sheet appears
   - Face ID / Touch ID
   - Receipt returned

✅ Error handling:
   - User cancelled: Normal flow
   - Payment failed: Show message
   - Deferred (family sharing): Handle later
```

#### AC5: Pending Transactions
```
✅ Handle app restart during purchase:
   - Listen for pending transactions
   - Complete incomplete purchases
   - Don't double-charge

✅ purchaseStream:
   - Stream<PurchaseResult> for updates
   - Process on app launch
```

#### AC6: Unit Tests Pass
```
✅ Test: Products fetched correctly (mock)
✅ Test: Purchase initiates platform dialog
✅ Test: Success returns transaction ID
✅ Test: Cancellation handled gracefully
✅ Test: Pending transactions resumed
```

### Implementation Notes

### Objective
Implement server-side receipt validation via Firebase Cloud Functions.

### User Story
As a developer, I need server-side validation to prevent fraud and ensure all purchases are legitimate.

   - axios (Apple API)
   - firebase-admin (Firestore)
```

#### AC2: Google Play Validation
```
✅ Android receipt validation:
   - Call androidpublisher.purchases.products.get()
   - Check purchaseState === 0 (purchased)
   - Return isValid: true/false

   - Credentials stored in Cloud Functions config
   - Proper IAM permissions
```

#### AC3: Apple App Store Validation
```
✅ iOS receipt validation:
   - POST to https://buy.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt
   - Include shared secret
   - Check status === 0

✅ Sandbox testing:
   - Use sandbox URL for development
   - Switch to production for release
```

#### AC4: Transaction Logging

✅ Log to Firestore:
   - /users/{uid}/purchases/transactions
   - Fields: productId, platform, transactionId, validated, date

✅ Audit trail:
   - All attempts logged (valid and invalid)
   - Fraud detection data
```

#### AC5: Security
```
✅ Security measures:
   - Authenticated users only
   - Rate limiting: 10 attempts/hour
   - Duplicate receipt detection
   - Receipt data encrypted

✅ Firestore Security Rules:
   - Users can READ purchases
   - Only Cloud Functions can WRITE
```

#### AC6: Unit Tests Pass
```
✅ Test: Valid Android receipt returns true
✅ Test: Invalid receipt returns false
✅ Test: Transaction logged to Firestore
✅ Test: Duplicate receipt rejected
✅ Test: Rate limiting works
```

### Implementation Notes

**Files to Create:**
- `functions/src/validateReceipt.js` - Cloud Function
- `functions/src/index.js` - Export function
- `lib/data/services/receipt_validator.dart` - Client caller

    .call({
      'platform': 'android',
      'receiptData': receiptToken,
      'productId': 'factory_pack',
    });
```

**Dependencies:**

   - Grant reward anyway
   - Log: ad_not_available

✅ Ad failed to show:
   - Grant reward anyway
   - Log: ad_show_failed

✅ Remove Ads purchased:
   - Skip ads entirely
   - Grant rewards automatically
```

#### AC5: AdManager Implementation
```dart
✅ AdManager class:
   - initialize(): Load first ad
   - showRewardedAd(placement): Show and grant reward
   - preloadAd(): Load next ad

   - AdWatchFailure (error)
```

#### AC6: Unit Tests Pass
```
✅ Test: Ad loads successfully (mock)
✅ Test: Daily cap enforced at 6
✅ Test: Daily count resets at midnight
✅ Test: Ad failure grants reward
✅ Test: Remove Ads skips ad
```
