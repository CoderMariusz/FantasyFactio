## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**The Problem:** Factorio fans and mid-core mobile gamers face a frustrating gap:

1. **Factorio has NO official mobile version** - 3.5M+ Steam players want mobile automation
2. **Mobile "factory builders" are too casual** - Builderment (1.5M downloads) simplifies mechanics for mass appeal
3. **No mobile game teaches economics through gameplay** - Educational value is untapped
4. **Existing solutions force a choice:** Desktop complexity OR mobile simplicity - but not both

**Who's affected:**
- **Factorio fans** traveling, commuting, wanting quick sessions away from desktop
- **Mobile gamers** seeking depth beyond casual tap-to-upgrade games
- **Parents** wanting educational value in their kids' mobile games
- **Economics enthusiasts** who want to learn supply/demand through play

**Current workarounds:**
- Stream Factorio to mobile (laggy, impractical)
- Play casual builders (Builderment) but miss the depth
- Wait for an official Factorio mobile port (not planned)
- Avoid mobile automation games entirely

### Problem Impact

**For Players:**
- **Lost opportunity cost:** 2-3 hours/day of commute/downtime = wasted potential for engaging gameplay
- **Educational gap:** Economics literacy could be learned through play, not textbooks
- **Frustration:** Desire for complex automation exists but is unmet on mobile

**For the Market:**
- **Underserved segment:** Mid-core mobile gamers (rising from 5 to 10 titles in top 200 grossing in 2025)
- **Revenue potential:** D7 retention of 40% + ethical F2P = $10 LTV (vs $4-6 industry average)
- **Cross-platform opportunity:** Mobile-first → Desktop expansion (inverted typical port strategy)

**Quantified Impact (from Market Research):**
- 10k downloads = $28.8k Year 1 revenue (if 40% D7 retention achieved)
- 100k downloads = $288k Year 1 revenue (viral scenario)
- Market gap = $400M SAM (factory automation + educational mobile games)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Factorio (PC/Mac/Linux):**
- ❌ NO mobile version (developers not planning mobile port)
- ❌ Desktop controls (mouse + keyboard required)
- ❌ Session length (requires 30-60 min focused sessions)
- ✅ Depth and complexity (gold standard for automation)

**Builderment (Mobile):**
- ✅ Mobile-optimized controls
- ✅ Short session support (2-5 min sessions viable)
- ❌ Oversimplified mechanics (casual, not mid-core)
- ❌ No economic education (just production chains)
- ❌ Limited endgame depth (1.5M downloads but low retention)

**Idle/Clicker "Factories":**
- ✅ Mobile-first design
- ❌ Zero automation skill required (just tap-to-upgrade)
- ❌ No strategic depth
- ❌ Aggressive monetization (energy systems, P2W)

**The Gap:**
NO game combines:
- Desktop-quality automation complexity
- Mobile-first touch controls
- Economic education through gameplay
- Ethical F2P monetization
- 30s-60min flexible session support

**Trade Factory Masters fills this exact gap.**

### Proposed Solution

**Trade Factory Masters** is a **mobile-first factory automation game** that proves complex systems work on touchscreens - delivering Factorio-inspired depth with:

**Core Innovation: Progressive Complexity as Reward**

Instead of overwhelming players with complexity upfront (Factorio's problem), Trade Factory Masters **unlocks complexity as achievements**:

- **Tier 1 (0-5h):** Manual tap collection, fixed prices, 5 buildings
  - Players learn: Resource flow, supply chains, basic economy
  - Mobile-friendly: One-handed, 30s sessions viable

- **Tier 2 (5-15h):** Smart conveyors unlock, price fluctuations, 11 buildings
  - Players learn: Automation value, market timing, efficiency
  - Conveyors = REWARD for Tier 1 mastery

- **Tier 3 (15-30h):** Manual optimization, full economy, 19 buildings
  - Players learn: Supply/demand, optimization, complex chains
  - Mid-core depth achieved

- **Tier 4 (30-100h):** Endgame mastery, player market, guild projects
  - Factorio-level complexity unlocked

**Key Differentiator: "Factorio in 1 Tap"**

- **Smart conveyor routing:** AI suggests paths, player confirms (not tedious placement)
- **Offline production:** O(1) calculation (not simulation) - respects player time
- **3-step core loop:** COLLECT (10s) → DECIDE (20s) → UPGRADE (30s)
  - Works in 30s commute session OR 60min deep dive

**Economic Education Layer:**

- Learn supply/demand through gameplay events (dragon attacks drop supply → prices spike)
- No tutorials - discovery-based learning
- Parents approve educational value (68% prioritize this per research)

**Technical Approach (Validated):**

- **Flutter/Flame engine:** 60 FPS on budget Android (Snapdragon 660)
- **Firebase backend:** $3/month for 10k users (scalable to 100k for $45/month)
- **Sprite batching:** 50+ conveyors render smoothly
- **Cross-platform ready:** Mobile MVP → Desktop port in 3-4 weeks

**Ethical F2P Model:**

- **Total cost: $10** to "complete" the game
  - Ad removal: $2.99
  - DLC (Tiers 3-4): $2.99
  - Cosmetics: $1.99
  - Rewarded ads: Optional (2x offline production)

- **NO energy systems, loot boxes, or P2W**
- Transparent pricing (EU regulatory tailwind in 2025)

### Key Differentiators

1. **Only mid-core automation on mobile** - Fills gap between Factorio (desktop) and Builderment (casual)

2. **Progressive complexity unlock** - Conveyors are REWARD, not starting feature (unique approach)

3. **Economic education embedded** - Supply/demand learned through gameplay, not textbooks

4. **Ethical F2P ($10 complete game)** - Industry standard is $50-200 for "full experience"

5. **Cross-platform roadmap** - Mobile-first → Desktop expansion (inverted typical strategy)

6. **Smart automation UX** - AI-assisted conveyor routing (not tedious manual placement)

7. **Offline production** - O(1) calculation (respects player time, no simulation)

8. **Flexible session length** - 30s viable OR 60min deep dive (same core loop scales)

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must-Have for Launch)

**These features define the product - without them, it's not Trade Factory Masters:**

**MVP Scope: Tier 1-2 ONLY (0-7 hours gameplay)**

#### 1. Core Gameplay Loop (CRITICAL)

**3-Step Loop:** COLLECT (10s) → DECIDE (20s) → UPGRADE (30s)

- **COLLECT:** Tap resources on buildings (wood, ore, food)
- **DECIDE:** Choose what to buy/sell based on prices
- **UPGRADE:** Improve buildings or unlock new ones

**Why Critical:** This loop must work in 30s sessions AND 60min sessions - proves mobile viability

**Implementation:**
- Manual tap collection (Tier 1)
- Resource inventory system
- Price display (fixed in Tier 1, dynamic in Tier 2)
- Building upgrade system

#### 2. Tier 1 Economy System (0-5h)

**Buildings (5 total):**
1. Lumbermill → Wood
2. Mine → Ore
3. Farm → Food
4. Smelter → Bars (Wood + Ore)
5. Workshop → Tools (Bars + Wood)

**Resources (7 types):**
- Raw: Wood, Ore, Food
- Processed: Bars, Tools
- Advanced: Circuits, Machines (unlock in Tier 2)

**Economy Mechanics:**
- **Fixed prices** (no fluctuations in Tier 1)
- Buy/sell resources to NPC market
- Profit = buying cheap inputs, selling expensive outputs
- Simple supply chains (2-3 steps max)

**Why Critical:** Teaches core economic concepts without overwhelming - discovery-based learning

#### 3. Tier 2 Automation System (5-7h)

**Smart Conveyor Routing (THE "aha moment"):**

**Risk 1: Core Loop Doesn't Engage (HIGH IMPACT)**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** If players don't find COLLECT→DECIDE→UPGRADE fun, game fails
- **Mitigation:** Playtest Tier 1 extensively, iterate before scaling
- **Early Warning:** D1 retention <40%, session length <2min average

**Risk 2: Tier 1 Too Boring / Tier 2 Too Complex (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** <60% players reach Tier 2 = lose "aha moment"
- **Mitigation:** Balance testing, tutorial iteration
- **Early Warning:** Tier 2 unlock rate <50% in first week

**Risk 3: Technology Doesn't Scale (HIGH IMPACT)**
- **Probability:** LOW (validated in research)
- **Impact:** <60 FPS on budget devices = negative reviews, uninstalls
- **Mitigation:** Test on Snapdragon 660 from Week 2, optimize early
- **Early Warning:** Performance complaints in first 100 reviews

**Risk 4: Market Saturation / Competition (LOW IMPACT)**
- **Probability:** LOW
- **Impact:** If Factorio launches mobile OR competitor fills gap
- **Mitigation:** Speed to market, niche positioning (economics education)
- **Monitoring:** Watch Factorio dev blogs, competitor landscape

**Risk 5: Monetization Doesn't Convert (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** <2% conversion = revenue miss
- **Mitigation:** A/B test pricing, offer bundles, iterate
- **Early Warning:** Conversion <1% in first month

**Risk 6: Firebase Costs Spike Unexpectedly (LOW IMPACT)**
- **Probability:** LOW
- **Impact:** If costs exceed $100/month at 50k MAU
- **Mitigation:** Monitor Firebase console, set alerts, optimize queries
- **Fallback:** Migrate to dedicated server if truly necessary (only if 200k+ MAU)

### Success Dependencies

**Must-Haves for Success:**
1. **Core loop is engaging** - Players find COLLECT→DECIDE→UPGRADE satisfying
2. **Performance hits 60 FPS** - No lag, smooth on budget devices
3. **Tier 2 unlock rate >60%** - Players reach automation "aha moment"
4. **D7 Retention >30%** - Above industry average, ideally 35-40%
5. **Factorio community endorsement** - Reddit, YouTube creators validate

**Nice-to-Haves (Accelerators):**
- App Store / Google Play featuring
- Influencer coverage (YouTube, Twitch)
- Viral moment (e.g., "Factorio on mobile!" Reddit post)
- Parent/educator recommendations (economics angle)

**Red Flags (Kill Switches):**
- D7 Retention <20% after Month 1 → Core loop broken, pivot or abandon
- <45 FPS on Snapdragon 660 → Tech debt unsolvable, reevaluate
- Factorio official mobile announced → Market evaporates, pivot niche

- **Year 1 estimate:** <$360 total ($30/month avg)

**Marketing (Organic-First):**
- Reddit posts: $0
- YouTube outreach: $0
- ASO optimization: $0 (DIY)
- Optional: Google Ads test ($100-500 budget)

**Total Year 1 Investment: $500-1,000** (mostly optional marketing)

### Revenue Projections

**Conservative Scenario (10k downloads, 35% D7):**
- Ad revenue: $18k/year (60% ad watch rate, $20 eCPM)
- IAP revenue: $8k/year (2% conversion, $10 ARPPU)
- **Total: $26k Year 1**
- **ROI:** 26x-52x (on $500-1k investment)

**Realistic Scenario (25k downloads, 38% D7):**
- Ad revenue: $45k/year
- IAP revenue: $20k/year
- **Total: $65k Year 1**

**Optimistic Scenario (100k downloads, 40% D7):**
- Ad revenue: $180k/year
- IAP revenue: $80k/year
- **Total: $260k Year 1**
- Transition to full-time indie dev viable

### Profitability Timeline

**Month 1-2:** Costs exceed revenue (~$200 investment, ~$100 revenue)
**Month 3-4:** Break-even (~$500 total costs, ~$500 revenue)
**Month 5-6:** Profitable (~$1k costs, ~$3-5k revenue)
**Month 7-12:** Sustainable (~$1k costs, ~$10-20k revenue)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

| Metric | Impact on Revenue | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| D7 -10% (30% vs 40%) | -40% revenue | Improve onboarding, core loop |
| eCPM -$10 ($10 vs $20) | -50% ad revenue | Focus US/EU markets, optimize ad UX |
| Downloads -50% (5k vs 10k) | -50% total revenue | Increase marketing, ASO iteration |
| Conversion -1% (1% vs 2%) | -50% IAP revenue | A/B test pricing, bundles |

**Break-Even Point:** 5,000 downloads with 30% D7 retention = ~$10k/year revenue (covers costs)

### Business Model Viability

**Why This Model Works:**

1. **Low Development Cost** - Solo indie, free tools, Firebase free tier
2. **High Margin** - 95%+ margin (Firebase costs <$500/year even at 50k MAU)
3. **Scalable** - Revenue scales linearly with downloads, costs scale logarithmically
4. **Ethical** - $10 cap builds trust, drives word-of-mouth, regulatory-friendly
5. **Cross-Platform Leverage** - Desktop port expands TAM with 85% code reuse

**Comparison to Traditional F2P:**

| Metric | Traditional F2P | Trade Factory Masters |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Complete Game Cost | $50-200 | $10 |
| Conversion Rate | 2-3% | 2% (similar) |
| ARPPU | $30-70 | $5-10 (lower) |
| D7 Retention | 20% avg | 35-40% target (higher) |
| LTV | $4-6 | $10+ (if 40% D7) |
| Player Trust | Low (P2W) | High (ethical) |

**Key Insight:** Lower ARPPU but HIGHER retention = similar/better LTV
