**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Author:** Mariusz (CoderMariusz)
**Context:** Indie Game - Mobile Factory Automation + Economics Education
**Project Type:** Greenfield - Enterprise BMAD Track

---

## Executive Summary

**Trade Factory Masters** fills a critical gap in the mobile gaming market: **desktop-quality factory automation for Factorio fans on mobile devices**.

The mobile gaming industry has been dominated by casual builders and simple idle games. Trade Factory Masters proves that **mobile can handle mid-core complexity** - delivering Factorio-inspired automation with economic education, optimized for touch controls and short sessions.

**Target Market:** 3.5M+ Factorio players who want a mobile version + mobile gamers seeking depth beyond casual builders

**Unique Positioning:** "Factorio in 1 tap" - Desktop-level automation complexity, mobile-first UX

**Revenue Model:** Ethical F2P - $10 total for "complete game" (vs $50-200 typical F2P)

**Tech Stack Validated:** Flutter/Flame can achieve 60 FPS with 50+ conveyors on budget Android devices (Technical Research completed 2025-11-17)

**Market Opportunity:**
- Mobile gaming: $135B market (2025)
- Factory automation on mobile: NO desktop-quality competitor exists
- Educational games: $6.23B market growing at 23.4% CAGR

**Primary Risk:** Technology complexity - Can mobile devices handle this?
**Risk Mitigation:** Technical validation complete - sprite batching, hierarchical pathfinding, Firebase backend proven

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**The Problem:** Factorio fans and mid-core mobile gamers face a frustrating gap:

1. **Factorio has NO official mobile version** - 3.5M+ Steam players want mobile automation
2. **Mobile "factory builders" are too casual** - Builderment (1.5M downloads) simplifies mechanics for mass appeal
3. **No mobile game teaches economics through gameplay** - Educational value is untapped
4. **Existing solutions force a choice:** Desktop complexity OR mobile simplicity - but not both

**Who's affected:**
- **Factorio fans** traveling, commuting, wanting quick sessions away from desktop
- **Mobile gamers** seeking depth beyond casual tap-to-upgrade games
- **Parents** wanting educational value in their kids' mobile games
- **Economics enthusiasts** who want to learn supply/demand through play

**Current workarounds:**
- Stream Factorio to mobile (laggy, impractical)
- Play casual builders (Builderment) but miss the depth
- Wait for an official Factorio mobile port (not planned)
- Avoid mobile automation games entirely

### Problem Impact

**For Players:**
- **Lost opportunity cost:** 2-3 hours/day of commute/downtime = wasted potential for engaging gameplay
- **Educational gap:** Economics literacy could be learned through play, not textbooks
- **Frustration:** Desire for complex automation exists but is unmet on mobile

**For the Market:**
- **Underserved segment:** Mid-core mobile gamers (rising from 5 to 10 titles in top 200 grossing in 2025)
- **Revenue potential:** D7 retention of 40% + ethical F2P = $10 LTV (vs $4-6 industry average)
- **Cross-platform opportunity:** Mobile-first → Desktop expansion (inverted typical port strategy)

**Quantified Impact (from Market Research):**
- 10k downloads = $28.8k Year 1 revenue (if 40% D7 retention achieved)
- 100k downloads = $288k Year 1 revenue (viral scenario)
- Market gap = $400M SAM (factory automation + educational mobile games)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Factorio (PC/Mac/Linux):**
- ❌ NO mobile version (developers not planning mobile port)
- ❌ Desktop controls (mouse + keyboard required)
- ❌ Session length (requires 30-60 min focused sessions)
- ✅ Depth and complexity (gold standard for automation)

**Builderment (Mobile):**
- ✅ Mobile-optimized controls
- ✅ Short session support (2-5 min sessions viable)
- ❌ Oversimplified mechanics (casual, not mid-core)
- ❌ No economic education (just production chains)
- ❌ Limited endgame depth (1.5M downloads but low retention)

**Idle/Clicker "Factories":**
- ✅ Mobile-first design
- ❌ Zero automation skill required (just tap-to-upgrade)
- ❌ No strategic depth
- ❌ Aggressive monetization (energy systems, P2W)

**The Gap:**
NO game combines:
- Desktop-quality automation complexity
- Mobile-first touch controls
- Economic education through gameplay
- Ethical F2P monetization
- 30s-60min flexible session support

**Trade Factory Masters fills this exact gap.**

### Proposed Solution

**Trade Factory Masters** is a **mobile-first factory automation game** that proves complex systems work on touchscreens - delivering Factorio-inspired depth with:

**Core Innovation: Progressive Complexity as Reward**

Instead of overwhelming players with complexity upfront (Factorio's problem), Trade Factory Masters **unlocks complexity as achievements**:

- **Tier 1 (0-5h):** Manual tap collection, fixed prices, 5 buildings
  - Players learn: Resource flow, supply chains, basic economy
  - Mobile-friendly: One-handed, 30s sessions viable

- **Tier 2 (5-15h):** Smart conveyors unlock, price fluctuations, 11 buildings
  - Players learn: Automation value, market timing, efficiency
  - Conveyors = REWARD for Tier 1 mastery

- **Tier 3 (15-30h):** Manual optimization, full economy, 19 buildings
  - Players learn: Supply/demand, optimization, complex chains
  - Mid-core depth achieved

- **Tier 4 (30-100h):** Endgame mastery, player market, guild projects
  - Factorio-level complexity unlocked

**Key Differentiator: "Factorio in 1 Tap"**

- **Smart conveyor routing:** AI suggests paths, player confirms (not tedious placement)
- **Offline production:** O(1) calculation (not simulation) - respects player time
- **3-step core loop:** COLLECT (10s) → DECIDE (20s) → UPGRADE (30s)
  - Works in 30s commute session OR 60min deep dive

**Economic Education Layer:**

- Learn supply/demand through gameplay events (dragon attacks drop supply → prices spike)
- No tutorials - discovery-based learning
- Parents approve educational value (68% prioritize this per research)

**Technical Approach (Validated):**

- **Flutter/Flame engine:** 60 FPS on budget Android (Snapdragon 660)
- **Firebase backend:** $3/month for 10k users (scalable to 100k for $45/month)
- **Sprite batching:** 50+ conveyors render smoothly
- **Cross-platform ready:** Mobile MVP → Desktop port in 3-4 weeks

**Ethical F2P Model:**

- **Total cost: $10** to "complete" the game
  - Ad removal: $2.99
  - DLC (Tiers 3-4): $2.99
  - Cosmetics: $1.99
  - Rewarded ads: Optional (2x offline production)

- **NO energy systems, loot boxes, or P2W**
- Transparent pricing (EU regulatory tailwind in 2025)

### Key Differentiators

1. **Only mid-core automation on mobile** - Fills gap between Factorio (desktop) and Builderment (casual)

2. **Progressive complexity unlock** - Conveyors are REWARD, not starting feature (unique approach)

3. **Economic education embedded** - Supply/demand learned through gameplay, not textbooks

4. **Ethical F2P ($10 complete game)** - Industry standard is $50-200 for "full experience"

5. **Cross-platform roadmap** - Mobile-first → Desktop expansion (inverted typical strategy)

6. **Smart automation UX** - AI-assisted conveyor routing (not tedious manual placement)

7. **Offline production** - O(1) calculation (respects player time, no simulation)

8. **Flexible session length** - 30s viable OR 60min deep dive (same core loop scales)
