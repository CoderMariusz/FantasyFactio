## Technique Sessions

### 🎯 Session 1: Core Gameplay Mechanics - First Principles Thinking

**Fundamental Truths Identified:**

1. **Mobile ≠ Desktop Players**
   - Sessions: 30s-2min (short), 5-10min (medium), 30-60min (long)
   - One-handed gameplay essential
   - Thumb-reach zone = primary actions
   - No assumptions from PC games (Factorio)

2. **Complexity as Reward, Not Default**
   - Start: 5 buildings → End: 30+ buildings over 50h
   - Conveyors are UNLOCK, not starting feature
   - Each layer of complexity = achievement/reward
   - Principle: "Depth ≠ Complexity"

3. **Progressive Unlock Philosophy**
   - **Tier 1 (0-5h):** Manual collection, fixed prices, 5 buildings
   - **Tier 2 (5-15h):** Smart conveyors unlock, price fluctuations, 11 buildings
   - **Tier 3 (15-30h):** Manual optimization, full economy, 19 buildings
   - **Tier 4 (30-100h):** Endgame, player market, mastery

4. **3-Step Core Loop** (Works in ANY session length)
   ```
   COLLECT (10s) → DECIDE (20s) → UPGRADE (30s)
   ```
   - Short session completes full loop
   - Long session = multiple loops + depth layers

5. **Learn by Discovery, Not Tutorials**
   - ❌ BAD: "Supply and demand is when..."
   - ✅ GOOD: Dragon attack → supply drops → price spikes → player profits → lesson learned
   - Economic literacy through gameplay events

6. **Automation Satisfaction Curve**
   ```
   Phase 1: Manual tap = pain point (creates desire)
            ↓
   Phase 2: Smart auto-routing = relief + satisfaction
            ↓
   Phase 3: Manual optimization = mastery (for 10% hardcore)
   ```

**Key Design Principles:**

- **90% Casual / 10% Hardcore Balance**
  - Casual: Simple, instant gratification, short sessions sufficient for progress
  - Hardcore: Optional depth (manual conveyors, optimization, market manipulation)

- **No Punishment for Short Sessions**
  - 30 second session = valid progress
  - Never force long engagement

- **Content Gating as Progression**
  - Every unlock feels earned
  - Complexity introduced when player ready
  - Natural tutorial through progressive features

**Revolutionary Conveyor Design:**

```
Hours 0-5:   NO CONVEYORS (creates pain/desire)
Hours 5-15:  SMART AUTO-ROUTING (relief/satisfaction)
Hours 15-30: MANUAL EDITING (mastery/optimization)
```

This inverts traditional approach - makes automation feel like achievement, not starting point.

**Economic Education Through Events:**

1. Supply & Demand: Plague → wheat scarcity → price spike
2. Arbitrage: Iron 10g North, 50g South → buy low/sell high
3. Market Manipulation: Stockpile → dump → price crash → lesson learned
4. Risk/Reward: Illegal goods (3x profit, 20% confiscation risk)

**Mobile-First Session Design:**

- **Short (30s-2min):** Collect + Quick Sell + One Upgrade
- **Medium (5-10min):** + Market Analysis + Build + Quest
- **Long (30-60min):** + Exploration + Major Projects + Multiplayer

All accessible from thumb-reach zone (bottom 1/3 screen).

**MVP Scope Clarity:**

Sprint 1 (Month 1):
- 5 tier-1 buildings
- Manual tap collection
- Fixed prices
- Basic tutorial (5 steps, 15 min)
- Target: >70% tutorial completion, >30% D1 retention

**Balancing Guidelines:**

- Building Cost = 2x return of 10 min production
- Tier value scaling: 1x → 3-5x → 10-20x → 50-100x → 1000x+
- Price events: Normal ±20%, Minor ±50%, Major ±200%, Catastrophe ±500%

**Total Ideas Generated in This Session:** 50+ specific mechanics, systems, and design decisions

### 🔬 Advanced Elicitation - Assumption Testing

**Critical Revisions After Challenge:**

**REVISION 1: Conveyor Timeline (MAJOR CHANGE)**
- ❌ Original: No conveyors 0-5h
- ✅ Revised: Progressive automation
  - **Hour 0-0.5:** Tutorial shows automation teaser (aspirational)
  - **Hour 0.5-2:** Storage auto-collect (QoL, not full automation)
  - **Hour 2:** First conveyor unlock (NOT 5h!)
  - **Hour 2-7:** Smart auto-routing expansion
  - **Hour 7-10:** Manual editing (NOT 15h!)

**Why Changed:**
- 5h manual risk = uninstall before discovering automation
- Competitors show auto-collect immediately
- 2h = engagement proven + frustration point (not quit point)
- Behavior-based unlock > fixed timer
- Teaser from minute 1 prevents "this is the whole game" perception

**REVISION 2: Player Segmentation (CONCEPTUAL SHIFT)**
- ❌ Original: "90% Casual / 10% Hardcore" (admitted: "bullshit without data")
- ✅ Revised: Spectrum Model
  - 0-5h: "Tourists" (50%?) - instant fun needed
  - 5-20h: "Regulars" (30%?) - progress feeling
  - 20-50h: "Invested" (15%?) - depth/optimization
  - 50-200h+: "Masters" (5%?) - endgame/community

**Why Changed:**
- Factory automation may attract more engaged players than typical mobile
- "Casual" ≠ stupid, can be smart but time-constrained
- Design: Core loop for all + optional depth layers (not forced simplification)
- Respect player intelligence: complex systems with simple interfaces

**REVISION 3: Educational System (HYBRID APPROACH)**
- ❌ Original: Pure discovery learning (risky - RNG-based education)
- ✅ Revised: Scripted + Random hybrid
  - **Guaranteed scripted events** for core lessons:
    - Hour 2: Small supply disruption (+30% prices)
    - Hour 10: War demand spike (weapon opportunity)
    - Hour 25: Trade embargo (black market unlock)
  - **Random events** = bonus excitement (not primary education)
  - **Optional explicit tutorials** (toggle in settings for analytical learners)

**Why Changed:**
- Player A experiences event ≠ Player B = unfair education
- Pure trial-and-error = some players feel stupid
- Telegraph events (hints before) = skill-based prediction
- Both discovery AND explicit paths valid

**REVISION 4: Smart Routing Improvements**
- ❌ Original: Trust auto-routing alone
- ✅ Revised: Preview + Player Control
  - **Preview before build** (show ghost path, cost estimate)
  - **Waypoint system** from start (player can guide routes)
  - **Alternative suggestions** (show 2nd best path option)
  - **Edge case handling** (blocked paths show clear options)
  - **Retrofit tool** at manual unlock (upgrade existing, don't rebuild)

**Why Changed:**
- Auto-routing may block future expansion
- Players need control without full complexity
- "Confirm before build" > instant auto-build
- Manual editing at 7-10h (not 15h) to avoid massive rebuilds

**Key Lessons from Assumption Testing:**

1. **Timing Matters More Than Theory**
   - "Create desire through pain" sounds good, but 5h too risky
   - 2h with teaser = proven engagement + manageable frustration

2. **Data > Assumptions**
   - "90/10 split" admitted as baseless
   - Behavior-based metrics > demographic assumptions
   - A/B testing required for timing validation

3. **Hybrid > Pure**
   - Not "discovery OR tutorials" but both (player choice)
   - Not "casual OR hardcore" but spectrum
   - Not "auto OR manual" but progressive evolution

4. **Respect Player Intelligence**
   - Simplify interface, not mechanics
   - "Smart casual" = limited time ≠ limited brain
   - Optional depth > forced simplicity

5. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**
   - Scripted educational events (guarantee learning)
   - Retrofit tools (avoid rebuild punishment)
   - Preview systems (prevent regret)
   - Behavior-based unlocks (rescue struggling players)

**Revised Critical Timeline:**

```
Hour 0:    Tutorial + Automation Teaser
Hour 0.5:  Storage auto-collect unlock
Hour 2:    First conveyor (behavior-based)
Hour 7:    Manual editing + retrofit tools
Hour 10:   Guaranteed educational event (war)
Hour 25:   Advanced mechanics unlock
```

**Most Critical Changes:**
1. ✅ Conveyor unlock: 2h (not 5h) with minute-1 teaser
2. ✅ Scripted educational events (not pure RNG)
3. ✅ Optional explicit tutorial mode
4. ✅ Routing preview + waypoints from start
5. ✅ Manual editing at 7-10h (not 15h)

### 🎯 Session 2: Technical Challenges - Five Whys + Systems Analysis

**Core Problem:** "Offline production must work"

**Five Whys Deep Dive:**

**Why #1:** Why is offline production critical?
- Mobile players don't play 24/7
- Must feel progress when away
- Competitors have offline earnings

**Why #2:** Why can't we just pause time?
- No incentive to return
- Competitive disadvantage
- Idle game genre expectation

**Why #3:** Why is calculating offline production technically HARD?

**4 Major Technical Challenges Identified:**

**1. State Complexity - Dependency Chains**
```
Coal Mine → Furnace → Iron Mill → Tool Factory
   (10/min)    (buffer: 100)    (needs 5 iron/min)
```

Problem: After 2h offline with 100-item buffer:
- Naive: `production = rate * time` ❌
- Reality: Overflow after 10min → deadlock → zero production
- Must simulate: O(n*m*t) complexity
- 100 buildings × 7 days = 1,008,000 iterations 💀

**2. Non-Linear Systems - Feedback Loops**
```
Coal Generator → needs Coal → Mine → needs Power → Generator
```

Death spiral: Generator runs out → no power → mine stops → no coal to restart
- Cannot use simple multiplication
- Requires iterative time-series simulation
- Must detect and prevent deadlocks

**3. Randomness & RNG - Fairness**

Problem: 10% critical craft chance over 100 offline crafts
- ❌ Re-roll at login = exploit (logout/login spam)
- ✅ Deterministic seeded RNG based on player ID + timestamp
- Guarantees same result for same offline period

**4. Event Timing - State Changes During Offline**

Example:
```
t=0: Production 10/min
t=10min: Upgrade completes → 20/min
t=120min: Player returns

Correct: (10 × 10) + (110 × 20) = 2,300 ✅
Wrong: 120 × 10 = 1,200 ❌
```

Must track event timeline and calculate piecewise.

**Critical Edge Cases:**

1. **Infinite Loops** - Circular dependencies (A needs B, B needs A)
2. **Storage Overflow** - 1000 capacity, 3000 produced → what happens?
3. **Resource Starvation** - Coal runs out at minute 5 → 115 minutes zero production
4. **Time Exploits** - Player changes system clock to get future production
5. **Float Precision** - 604,800 seconds × 0.0001 rate = accumulated errors

**Offline Duration Comparison:**

| Aspect | 7 Minutes | 7 Days |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Calculation | Simple: rate × time | Must simulate bottlenecks |
| Storage | Won't fill | 100% full + overflow |
| Resources | Minimal depletion | Complete exhaustion |
| Player expect | "Small bonus" | "Huge rewards" |
| Exploit risk | Low | High (time manipulation) |
| Calc time | <1ms | Potentially >1s (lag) |
| Balance impact | Minimal | Can break economy |

**Assumption Reversal: "What if offline production ISN'T necessary?"**

**Alternative Approaches Explored:**

**Option 1: No Offline Production (Hardcore)**
- Philosophy: Production = active play only
- Examples: Factorio multiplayer, EVE Online
- Pros: No exploits, competitive fairness
- Cons: Casual players fall behind → high churn

**Option 2: Pause When Offline (Pure Idle)**
- Time only counts when online
- Pros: Zero exploits, simple
- Cons: No idle progression feel, boring for casuals

**Option 3: Quest Reward System**
- Return after 6h → "Workers gathered resources!" (loot box)
- Pros: No calculations, easy balance, excitement
- Cons: Less strategic depth, doesn't reward optimization

**Option 4: Offline Managers (AdVenture Capitalist)**
- Buy "Offline Manager" with premium currency
- Only managed buildings produce offline
- Pros: Monetization, player choice, easy calc
- Cons: Pay-to-win perception, frustrating for F2P

**✅ RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Penalty System**

**Progressive Efficiency Decay:**

```javascript
Tier 1 (Early Game) - Simple Penalty:
  0-1h offline:  100% efficiency
  1-8h offline:  Linear decay to 40%
  8h+ offline:   Cap at 40%, max 8h worth

Tier 2 (Mid Game) - Offline Managers:
  Managed buildings:   80% efficiency
  Unmanaged buildings: 30% efficiency
  Strategic investment choice

Tier 3 (Late Game) - Advanced Automation:
  Research "Advanced AI Controllers"
  All buildings:       90-95% efficiency
  Only bottlenecks limit (storage/resources)
  Progression feel: "Now I can be offline"
```

**Efficiency Curve Options:**

```
Linear:      efficiency = max(0.2, 1.0 - (time/24h) × 0.8)
Exponential: efficiency = 0.3 + 0.7 × exp(-time/4h)
Step:        Different thresholds (0-1h, 1-4h, 4-24h)
```

**Player Presentation:**

```
"Welcome back! You were away for 6 hours."

Your factory produced:
  🏭 Theoretical max:      12,000 units
  ⚙️ Offline efficiency:   50%
  ✅ Actual production:    6,000 units

💡 Tip: Log in more often for full production!
💰 Managers can improve offline efficiency (upgrade available)
```

**Progression Layers:**

1. **Upgradeable Efficiency:**
   - Level 1: 30% max (default)
   - Level 2: 50% max (10,000 gold)
   - Level 3: 70% max (100,000 gold)
   - Level 4: 90% max (premium)

2. **Building-Specific Capability:**
   - Basic Mine: 30% offline
   - Advanced Mine: 60% offline
   - Automated Mine: 100% offline (endgame reward)

3. **Offline Focus Mechanic:**
   - Before logout: Choose focus (Iron/Coal/Tools)
   - Focused buildings: +20% efficiency
   - Others: -10%

**Solution Comparison Matrix:**

| Approach | Complexity | Balance | Player Feel | Exploit Risk |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Full simulation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| No offline | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐ |
| Fixed rewards | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| **Penalty system** | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Hybrid** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |

**Key Technical Decisions:**

1. ✅ **Hybrid penalty system** (not full simulation)
2. ✅ **O(1) calculation** (not O(n×t))
3. ✅ **24h cap** on offline rewards (exploit prevention)
4. ✅ **Progression-gated efficiency** (30% → 90% through upgrades)
5. ✅ **Deterministic RNG** (seeded by player+timestamp)
6. ✅ **Visual feedback** showing potential vs actual ("could have earned X more")

**Implementation Priorities:**

1. Prototype 3 penalty curve variants
2. Implement 24h cap + time validation
3. Design upgrade tree for offline efficiency
4. Add visual feedback system
5. Analytics tracking (retention vs offline settings)
6. Balance economic model (prevent offline breaking economy)

### 🎯 Session 3: MVP Scope - Resource Constraints

**Constraint:** 30 days, solo developer, $0 budget, prove concept

**TIER 1 (0-2h) - Foundation**

**Buildings: 4 (not 5)**
- ✅ Mine (extraction)
- ✅ Smelter (crafting)
- ✅ Storage (QoL)
- ✅ Market Stall (selling)
- ❌ Worker Hut - CUT (idle mechanic too early)

**Resources: 3 (not 5)**
- ✅ Iron Ore (base)
- ✅ Coal (fuel)
- ✅ Iron Bar (first craft: 2 Ore + 1 Coal → 1 Bar)
- ❌ Wood, Stone - deferred to Tier 2

**Why 3 resources?** Simple chain: Mine Ore → Smelt Bar → Sell

**Economy: Fixed Prices**
- Iron Ore: 5g
- Coal: 3g
- Iron Bar: 25g (profit: 12g per bar)

**Goal:** Make 1,000 gold
- Requires ~40 Iron Bars
- ~2h gameplay with manual collection
- Unlocks: First Conveyor + Tier 2

**TIER 2 (2-7h) - Automation**

**New Buildings: 5 (not 6)**
- ✅ Advanced Mine (2x speed)
- ✅ Blast Furnace (3x speed)
- ✅ Conveyor System (automation!)
- ✅ Large Storage (10x capacity)
- ✅ Coal Generator (needed for tier 3)
- ❌ Research Lab - CUT (too complex for MVP)

**New Resources: 4 (not 8)**
- ✅ Steel (Iron Bar + Coal + heat)
- ✅ Plank (Wood - NEW resource)
- ✅ Copper Ore (NEW mine type)
- ✅ Copper Wire (Copper craft)
- ❌ Brick, Glass, Steam - deferred to tier 3

**Economy: Scripted "Fake" Signals**
- Fixed base prices
- Daily message: "🔥 Steel demand HIGH today! +20%"
- Or: "💤 Iron oversupply. -20%"
- NOT: Real-time supply/demand math
- YES: Scripted daily hints (sufficient for education)

**Conveyors: Auto-routing with Preview**
1. Tap building A
2. Tap building B
3. Show ghost path + cost
4. [Confirm] or [Cancel]

**Goal:** Build automated Steel production
```
[Mine] → [Conveyor] → [Smelter] → [Conveyor] → [Blast Furnace] → [Storage]
```
First complex chain achievement.

**CUT FROM MVP ✂️**

**Completely OUT:**
- ❌ Tier 3-4 (unlock in Update 1.1, 4-6 weeks post-launch)
- ❌ Manual conveyor editing (only smart auto-routing in MVP)
- ❌ Full economic system (only fake daily price hints)
- ❌ Multiplayer (maybe Year 2)
- ❌ Multiple regions/NPCs (1 generic NPC max)

**Minimal Inclusion:**
- ⚠️ Events: 1 scripted only
  - @ Hour 4: "⚠️ Mine Collapse!"
  - Iron Ore supply -50% for 1 hour
  - Prices +50%
  - Tutorial economic lesson

- ⚠️ NPC: 1 only - "Merchant Marcus"
  - Generic trader
  - Simple dialog: "Buy? Sell?"
  - No personality, no quests in MVP

**TUTORIAL 📚**

**Duration: 10 minutes MAX**

Step 1 (2 min): Tap mine → collect ore
Step 2 (2 min): Tap smelter → craft iron bar
Step 3 (2 min): Sell at market → get gold
Step 4 (2 min): Buy second mine → place it
Step 5 (2 min): Check storage → see offline production teaser

**Goal:** >80% completion
**Rule:** Keep each step <2 min, zero text walls, instant feedback

**OFFLINE PRODUCTION ⏰**

**Tier 1: 40% efficiency, 4h cap**
- Online: 10 Iron Ore/min = 600/hour
- Offline: 4 Iron Ore/min = 240/hour
- Max: 4 hours = 960 Iron Ore
- Message: "While away: +960 Iron Ore (4h)"

**Tier 2: 60% efficiency, 8h cap**
- Large Storage unlock = increases offline cap
- Better buildings = better efficiency

**Why penalty?**
- Incentivizes returning
- Doesn't kill casual progress
- Feels fair ("machines run slower unmaintained")

**SIGNATURE FEATURE: Smart Conveyors on Mobile**
- USP: "Factorio automation in 1 tap"
- Marketing: "See your factory work while you sleep"
- Visual: Satisfying item flow animations
- NOT: "Economic education" (too niche)
- NOT: "AI NPCs" (cut from MVP)

**CONTENT SUFFICIENCY: 7h Content = OK IF:**
- ✅ Clear roadmap in-game: "Update 1.1: New Buildings!"
- ✅ Leaderboard (competitive retention)
- ✅ Daily quests (stretch current content)
- ✅ Soft cap @ 7h: "You've mastered basics! More coming soon"

Player quits @ 7h with "needs more content" = SUCCESS if retention metrics good.

**MVP SUCCESS METRICS:**

**Minimum Viable:**
- Tutorial completion: >70%
- D1 retention: >30%
- D7 retention: >12%
- Session length: >3 min average
- Conveyor usage: >50% unlock

**Good:**
- Tutorial completion: >80%
- D1 retention: >40%
- D7 retention: >20%
- Session length: >5 min
- Conveyor usage: >70%

**Great (unlikely for MVP):**
- Tutorial completion: >85%
- D1 retention: >50%
- D7 retention: >25%
- Session length: >8 min
- Reviews: 4+ stars

**FINAL MVP SUMMARY:**

```
Total Content:
├─ 9 buildings (4 tier 1, 5 tier 2)
├─ 7 resources (3 tier 1, 4 tier 2)
├─ 7 hours gameplay
├─ 1 NPC
├─ 10 minute tutorial
├─ 1 scripted event
├─ Smart conveyors (auto-routing only)
└─ Fake economic signals (scripted daily)

Development Time: 30 days
Team: Solo + 1 contract artist
Budget: $0 (bootstrapped)
```

**Smart Cuts Analysis:**

1. ✅ **4 buildings not 5** - Worker Hut deferred (idle too early)
2. ✅ **3 resources not 5** - Simplest viable chain
3. ✅ **Fake economy not real** - Scripted hints = 90% of learning, 10% of complexity
4. ✅ **1 event not system** - Proves concept without infrastructure
5. ✅ **7h not 100h** - Sufficient to prove retention patterns
6. ✅ **Tutorial 10min not 15min** - Industry standard for mid-core mobile
