# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-11-17
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Mariusz

## Session Start

**Progressive Flow Approach Selected** - Comprehensive exploration across 6 key areas

### Session Plan

**Topic:** Trade Factory Masters - Mobile Factory Automation + Economy Game

**Approach:** Progressive Flow (Systematic exploration building from fundamentals to implementation)

**Areas to Explore (in order):**

1. **Core Gameplay Mechanics** - Balance automation with engaging gameplay
   - Technique: **First Principles Thinking** (15-20 min)
   - Goal: Understand fundamental game loop and player engagement

2. **Technical Challenges** - Offline production, sync, performance
   - Technique: **Five Whys** + **Assumption Reversal** (20 min)
   - Goal: Identify and solve critical technical problems

3. **MVP Scope** - What must be in first version
   - Technique: **Resource Constraints** + **Mind Mapping** (20 min)
   - Goal: Define essential features and cut scope intelligently

4. **Progression & Retention** - Long-term player engagement
   - Technique: **What If Scenarios** + **Time Shifting** (20 min)
   - Goal: Design compelling progression hooks

5. **Monetization** - F2P business model
   - Technique: **SCAMPER** + **Analogical Thinking** (15 min)
   - Goal: Ethical, profitable monetization strategy

6. **Multiplayer & Social** - Guilds, PvP, cooperation
   - Technique: **Role Playing** + **Yes And Building** (20 min)
   - Goal: Social features that drive retention

**Total Estimated Time:** ~2 hours

**Philosophy:** Build from core fundamentals → solve technical constraints → scope MVP → design long-term hooks → monetize ethically → add social multipliers

## Technique Sessions

### 🎯 Session 1: Core Gameplay Mechanics - First Principles Thinking

**Fundamental Truths Identified:**

1. **Mobile ≠ Desktop Players**
   - Sessions: 30s-2min (short), 5-10min (medium), 30-60min (long)
   - One-handed gameplay essential
   - Thumb-reach zone = primary actions
   - No assumptions from PC games (Factorio)

2. **Complexity as Reward, Not Default**
   - Start: 5 buildings → End: 30+ buildings over 50h
   - Conveyors are UNLOCK, not starting feature
   - Each layer of complexity = achievement/reward
   - Principle: "Depth ≠ Complexity"

3. **Progressive Unlock Philosophy**
   - **Tier 1 (0-5h):** Manual collection, fixed prices, 5 buildings
   - **Tier 2 (5-15h):** Smart conveyors unlock, price fluctuations, 11 buildings
   - **Tier 3 (15-30h):** Manual optimization, full economy, 19 buildings
   - **Tier 4 (30-100h):** Endgame, player market, mastery

4. **3-Step Core Loop** (Works in ANY session length)
   ```
   COLLECT (10s) → DECIDE (20s) → UPGRADE (30s)
   ```
   - Short session completes full loop
   - Long session = multiple loops + depth layers

5. **Learn by Discovery, Not Tutorials**
   - ❌ BAD: "Supply and demand is when..."
   - ✅ GOOD: Dragon attack → supply drops → price spikes → player profits → lesson learned
   - Economic literacy through gameplay events

6. **Automation Satisfaction Curve**
   ```
   Phase 1: Manual tap = pain point (creates desire)
            ↓
   Phase 2: Smart auto-routing = relief + satisfaction
            ↓
   Phase 3: Manual optimization = mastery (for 10% hardcore)
   ```

**Key Design Principles:**

- **90% Casual / 10% Hardcore Balance**
  - Casual: Simple, instant gratification, short sessions sufficient for progress
  - Hardcore: Optional depth (manual conveyors, optimization, market manipulation)

- **No Punishment for Short Sessions**
  - 30 second session = valid progress
  - Never force long engagement

- **Content Gating as Progression**
  - Every unlock feels earned
  - Complexity introduced when player ready
  - Natural tutorial through progressive features

**Revolutionary Conveyor Design:**

```
Hours 0-5:   NO CONVEYORS (creates pain/desire)
Hours 5-15:  SMART AUTO-ROUTING (relief/satisfaction)
Hours 15-30: MANUAL EDITING (mastery/optimization)
```

This inverts traditional approach - makes automation feel like achievement, not starting point.

**Economic Education Through Events:**

1. Supply & Demand: Plague → wheat scarcity → price spike
2. Arbitrage: Iron 10g North, 50g South → buy low/sell high
3. Market Manipulation: Stockpile → dump → price crash → lesson learned
4. Risk/Reward: Illegal goods (3x profit, 20% confiscation risk)

**Mobile-First Session Design:**

- **Short (30s-2min):** Collect + Quick Sell + One Upgrade
- **Medium (5-10min):** + Market Analysis + Build + Quest
- **Long (30-60min):** + Exploration + Major Projects + Multiplayer

All accessible from thumb-reach zone (bottom 1/3 screen).

**MVP Scope Clarity:**

Sprint 1 (Month 1):
- 5 tier-1 buildings
- Manual tap collection
- Fixed prices
- Basic tutorial (5 steps, 15 min)
- Target: >70% tutorial completion, >30% D1 retention

**Balancing Guidelines:**

- Building Cost = 2x return of 10 min production
- Tier value scaling: 1x → 3-5x → 10-20x → 50-100x → 1000x+
- Price events: Normal ±20%, Minor ±50%, Major ±200%, Catastrophe ±500%

**Total Ideas Generated in This Session:** 50+ specific mechanics, systems, and design decisions
