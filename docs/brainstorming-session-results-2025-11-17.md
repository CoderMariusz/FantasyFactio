## Technique Sessions

### 🎯 Session 1: Core Gameplay Mechanics - First Principles Thinking

**Fundamental Truths Identified:**

1. **Mobile ≠ Desktop Players**
   - Sessions: 30s-2min (short), 5-10min (medium), 30-60min (long)
   - One-handed gameplay essential
   - Thumb-reach zone = primary actions
   - No assumptions from PC games (Factorio)

2. **Complexity as Reward, Not Default**
   - Start: 5 buildings → End: 30+ buildings over 50h
   - Conveyors are UNLOCK, not starting feature
   - Each layer of complexity = achievement/reward
   - Principle: "Depth ≠ Complexity"

3. **Progressive Unlock Philosophy**
   - **Tier 1 (0-5h):** Manual collection, fixed prices, 5 buildings
   - **Tier 2 (5-15h):** Smart conveyors unlock, price fluctuations, 11 buildings
   - **Tier 3 (15-30h):** Manual optimization, full economy, 19 buildings
   - **Tier 4 (30-100h):** Endgame, player market, mastery

4. **3-Step Core Loop** (Works in ANY session length)
   ```
   COLLECT (10s) → DECIDE (20s) → UPGRADE (30s)
   ```
   - Short session completes full loop
   - Long session = multiple loops + depth layers

5. **Learn by Discovery, Not Tutorials**
   - ❌ BAD: "Supply and demand is when..."
   - ✅ GOOD: Dragon attack → supply drops → price spikes → player profits → lesson learned
   - Economic literacy through gameplay events

6. **Automation Satisfaction Curve**
   ```
   Phase 1: Manual tap = pain point (creates desire)
            ↓
   Phase 2: Smart auto-routing = relief + satisfaction
            ↓
   Phase 3: Manual optimization = mastery (for 10% hardcore)
   ```

**Key Design Principles:**

- **90% Casual / 10% Hardcore Balance**
  - Casual: Simple, instant gratification, short sessions sufficient for progress
  - Hardcore: Optional depth (manual conveyors, optimization, market manipulation)

- **No Punishment for Short Sessions**
  - 30 second session = valid progress
  - Never force long engagement

- **Content Gating as Progression**
  - Every unlock feels earned
  - Complexity introduced when player ready
  - Natural tutorial through progressive features

**Revolutionary Conveyor Design:**

```
Hours 0-5:   NO CONVEYORS (creates pain/desire)
Hours 5-15:  SMART AUTO-ROUTING (relief/satisfaction)
Hours 15-30: MANUAL EDITING (mastery/optimization)
```

This inverts traditional approach - makes automation feel like achievement, not starting point.

**Economic Education Through Events:**

1. Supply & Demand: Plague → wheat scarcity → price spike
2. Arbitrage: Iron 10g North, 50g South → buy low/sell high
3. Market Manipulation: Stockpile → dump → price crash → lesson learned
4. Risk/Reward: Illegal goods (3x profit, 20% confiscation risk)

**Mobile-First Session Design:**

- **Short (30s-2min):** Collect + Quick Sell + One Upgrade
- **Medium (5-10min):** + Market Analysis + Build + Quest
- **Long (30-60min):** + Exploration + Major Projects + Multiplayer

All accessible from thumb-reach zone (bottom 1/3 screen).

**MVP Scope Clarity:**

Sprint 1 (Month 1):
- 5 tier-1 buildings
- Manual tap collection
- Fixed prices
- Basic tutorial (5 steps, 15 min)
- Target: >70% tutorial completion, >30% D1 retention

**Balancing Guidelines:**

- Building Cost = 2x return of 10 min production
- Tier value scaling: 1x → 3-5x → 10-20x → 50-100x → 1000x+
- Price events: Normal ±20%, Minor ±50%, Major ±200%, Catastrophe ±500%

**Total Ideas Generated in This Session:** 50+ specific mechanics, systems, and design decisions

### 🔬 Advanced Elicitation - Assumption Testing

**Critical Revisions After Challenge:**

**REVISION 1: Conveyor Timeline (MAJOR CHANGE)**
- ❌ Original: No conveyors 0-5h
- ✅ Revised: Progressive automation
  - **Hour 0-0.5:** Tutorial shows automation teaser (aspirational)
  - **Hour 0.5-2:** Storage auto-collect (QoL, not full automation)
  - **Hour 2:** First conveyor unlock (NOT 5h!)
  - **Hour 2-7:** Smart auto-routing expansion
  - **Hour 7-10:** Manual editing (NOT 15h!)

**Why Changed:**
- 5h manual risk = uninstall before discovering automation
- Competitors show auto-collect immediately
- 2h = engagement proven + frustration point (not quit point)
- Behavior-based unlock > fixed timer
- Teaser from minute 1 prevents "this is the whole game" perception

**REVISION 2: Player Segmentation (CONCEPTUAL SHIFT)**
- ❌ Original: "90% Casual / 10% Hardcore" (admitted: "bullshit without data")
- ✅ Revised: Spectrum Model
  - 0-5h: "Tourists" (50%?) - instant fun needed
  - 5-20h: "Regulars" (30%?) - progress feeling
  - 20-50h: "Invested" (15%?) - depth/optimization
  - 50-200h+: "Masters" (5%?) - endgame/community

**Why Changed:**
- Factory automation may attract more engaged players than typical mobile
- "Casual" ≠ stupid, can be smart but time-constrained
- Design: Core loop for all + optional depth layers (not forced simplification)
- Respect player intelligence: complex systems with simple interfaces

**REVISION 3: Educational System (HYBRID APPROACH)**
- ❌ Original: Pure discovery learning (risky - RNG-based education)
- ✅ Revised: Scripted + Random hybrid
  - **Guaranteed scripted events** for core lessons:
    - Hour 2: Small supply disruption (+30% prices)
    - Hour 10: War demand spike (weapon opportunity)
    - Hour 25: Trade embargo (black market unlock)
  - **Random events** = bonus excitement (not primary education)
  - **Optional explicit tutorials** (toggle in settings for analytical learners)

**Why Changed:**
- Player A experiences event ≠ Player B = unfair education
- Pure trial-and-error = some players feel stupid
- Telegraph events (hints before) = skill-based prediction
- Both discovery AND explicit paths valid

**REVISION 4: Smart Routing Improvements**
- ❌ Original: Trust auto-routing alone
- ✅ Revised: Preview + Player Control
  - **Preview before build** (show ghost path, cost estimate)
  - **Waypoint system** from start (player can guide routes)
  - **Alternative suggestions** (show 2nd best path option)
  - **Edge case handling** (blocked paths show clear options)
  - **Retrofit tool** at manual unlock (upgrade existing, don't rebuild)

**Why Changed:**
- Auto-routing may block future expansion
- Players need control without full complexity
- "Confirm before build" > instant auto-build
- Manual editing at 7-10h (not 15h) to avoid massive rebuilds

**Key Lessons from Assumption Testing:**

1. **Timing Matters More Than Theory**
   - "Create desire through pain" sounds good, but 5h too risky
   - 2h with teaser = proven engagement + manageable frustration

2. **Data > Assumptions**
   - "90/10 split" admitted as baseless
   - Behavior-based metrics > demographic assumptions
   - A/B testing required for timing validation

3. **Hybrid > Pure**
   - Not "discovery OR tutorials" but both (player choice)
   - Not "casual OR hardcore" but spectrum
   - Not "auto OR manual" but progressive evolution

4. **Respect Player Intelligence**
   - Simplify interface, not mechanics
   - "Smart casual" = limited time ≠ limited brain
   - Optional depth > forced simplicity

5. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**
   - Scripted educational events (guarantee learning)
   - Retrofit tools (avoid rebuild punishment)
   - Preview systems (prevent regret)
   - Behavior-based unlocks (rescue struggling players)

**Revised Critical Timeline:**

```
Hour 0:    Tutorial + Automation Teaser
Hour 0.5:  Storage auto-collect unlock
Hour 2:    First conveyor (behavior-based)
Hour 7:    Manual editing + retrofit tools
Hour 10:   Guaranteed educational event (war)
Hour 25:   Advanced mechanics unlock
```

**Most Critical Changes:**
1. ✅ Conveyor unlock: 2h (not 5h) with minute-1 teaser
2. ✅ Scripted educational events (not pure RNG)
3. ✅ Optional explicit tutorial mode
4. ✅ Routing preview + waypoints from start
5. ✅ Manual editing at 7-10h (not 15h)
